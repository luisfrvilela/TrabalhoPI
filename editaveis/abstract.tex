\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   The project developed consists of a set of engineering students with the aid of advisors which aim to draw up a set of research and planning that will result in an improvement project that use exclusively technological solutions for the urban park of the Gama-DF. This must be detailed in order to be possible future use of ideas described through simulations, schematic and descriptive text. The methodology adopted was the SCRUM. Initially, a search on the Park was accomplished through a technical visit, visit to the Gama administration and search for other sources of information.  An initial contact was conducted with residents of the surrounding area in order to determine the main problems to be faced during the project. On this basis a WBS (work breakdown structure project) and a scope were determined. Possible solutions and feasibility studies were carried out and will be submitted for approval by a Board of evaluators in the first control point for the project quality control.
